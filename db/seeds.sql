        "This must rank as the best film (along with part 2)of all time.An ensemble performance that has no weak spot. Particularly, John Cazale ( Fredo) and Richard Castellano ( Clemenza) give wonderfully understated performances. You just have to believe that Castellano WAS Clemenza, he brings a real touch to his role. John Cazale brings the troubled Fredo to life, and you can see the weak Fredo desperately trying to live up to the family reputation but knowing that he can never be what his father wants. The story of one man's reluctance to be drawn into the murky family business,and his gradual change through circumstance, paints a vivid picture of this violent period of US history. Do not miss this film!"

        "This movie is a work of art. The finest sequel ever made. I don't think we will see another movie like this for a long time. Heath Ledger's Joker is the best movie charachter I have ever seen by far. Avengers Endgame is great, but The Dark Knight is much better. The best Batman ever! The best Joker ever! The best DC movie ever! The best superhero movie ever! Ando for me, the best movie ever!"

        "Saying that this film starts where `Two Towers' left off is somewhat misleading, for the film starts a great distance from the walls of Helm's Deep. `Return of the King' opens with a flashback of Smeagol (Andy Serkis) obtaining the one ring of power and an origin of his deterioration into the creature Gollum. This opening recaptures an emphasis that was somewhat lost within the epic battles of `Two Towers,' at that's the ring. The first installment, `The Fellowship of the Ring,' provided heaps of exposition on the ring's importance and influence, and in `Return of the King,' we see it pay off, big time."

        "One of my favorites! Such a beautiful film with superb acting! I went to the movies üçø to see Forrest Gump when it was first shown on the silver screen. I haven‚Äôt seen it in a really long time so I decided to watch it on Showtime! I still love it and Tom Hanks is one of my favorite actors. He was great in both this movie and in Philadelphia where he played a gay man stricken with aids and wrongfully fired from his position as a cracker jack attorney because his boss was a bigot played by Jason Robards (another great actor). Denzel Washington was superb in his role as Hanks‚Äô defense attorney as well. Tom Hanks has made many films over the years that I thoroughly enjoy but Forrest Gump is one of my favorites! He deserves every Oscar and other accolades he‚Äôs won due to his impeccable acting skills!"
